        <h1>How to play snake game?</h1>
        <div class="game">
            <p class="paragraph">
                When you load the page, you will see a snake, length of five square at top of left corner, with randomly
                placed three food boxes in the board. Some obstacles are also placed in the middle of the grid. At the beginning of the movement, Snake will move toward the right
                side of board. Once you start playing game you can move snake to all four direction by pressing arrow
                keys which should correspond to the respective direction of arrow keys. (i.e the left arrow should move snake to
                leftwards, uparrow to upwards,and so on.). Snake movement is restricted with timer event. In every 300
                milliseconds timer tells snake to move. While moving the snake in the grid, if the one targeted food and
                snake head meet then snake eat the food and the food becomes snake head and length of snake increases by
                five square grids. After eating each food, new food appears randomly in free grid space. Each eaten food
                is worth 10 points and each points will be added after eating food. While moving the snake, if head of
                snake collides within its body or at the wall of the board or within the obstacles in any directions then the game will be over.
                The game over condition will be notified and the current scores will be displayed in the
                modal. Every moves of snake will shown in the barChart. The game can restart again using userInterface, snake and score book keeping will initialized again in the
                same way as the very starting of the game. The game can be easily paused and played by using space key in the middle of game.

                I used HTML,JavaScript,CSS to develop this game. I used 20 x 20 grid to make the board. It was quite
                hard to fulfill all requirements of this task but I tried my best. It took me almost 4 hours per day. I
                complete this task in 30 days.
